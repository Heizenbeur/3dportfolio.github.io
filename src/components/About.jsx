        I am a highly skilled neuroscientist with expertise in a wide range of techniques. 
        I have experience performing intricate rat brain surgeries and using chemogenetics and 
        optogenetics to manipulate brain activity in vivo. Additionally, I am proficient in using 
        fiber photometry to record signals in freely behaving rats and have developed highly complex 
        behavioral paradigms to study decision-making in rats. My research has primarily focused on 
        the influence of value and cues on action selection when faced with a choice situation.

        As an excellent histologist, microscopist, and brain anatomist, I have a keen eye for detail 
        and a deep understanding of the complex structures within the brain. My passion for 
        neuroscience has led me to pursue a career in academia at the CNRS in France, where I 
        hope to make significant contributions to the field.

        Overall, I am confident that my diverse skill set and deep interest in neuroscience will 
        enable me to make important contributions to our understanding of the brain and its complexities.
